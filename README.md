# De-facer

*KAIST 2019 Fall CS470 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence Team 13 Final Project*

Service to detect the faces from video and ***de-face***(replace with other image or blur) them.


## Motivation
As _YouTube_ is actively used and personal YouTubers are increasing, we often see private broadcasts on the streets. We also take authentication shots on the street to post on _Instagram_. However, in these cases, my face may appear in other people's broadcasts, and othersâ€™ faces may appear in my Instagram photos. We came up with an idea like this to address this issue.

## Models
We used the [pytorch implementation](https://github.com/timesler/facenet-pytorch) of ["FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832).
